Function: calculate_statistics(data, method='mean')

This function calculates statistical measures from a given dataset. It supports multiple calculation methods including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance.

Parameters:
- data: A list or array of numerical values. Must contain at least one element.
- method: A string specifying the calculation method. Valid options are 'mean', 'median', 'mode', 'std', and 'variance'. Default is 'mean'.

Returns:
- A float representing the calculated statistic value.

Raises:
- ValueError: If data is empty or method is not recognized.
- TypeError: If data contains non-numerical values.

Example Usage:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    result = calculate_statistics(numbers, method='mean')
    print(result)  # Output: 5.5

Implementation Notes:
The function uses NumPy for efficient numerical computations. For large datasets, consider using vectorized operations. The function handles edge cases such as single-element arrays and empty inputs gracefully.
