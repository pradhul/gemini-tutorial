API Documentation: RESTful Service Endpoints

The application provides a RESTful API for managing user data and resources. All endpoints require authentication via Bearer token in the Authorization header.

POST /api/users
Creates a new user. Requires JSON body with name (string, required) and email (string, required, must be valid email format). Returns created user object with status code 201.

PUT /api/users/:id
Updates an existing user by ID. Requires JSON body with name and/or email fields. Returns updated user object with status code 200.

DELETE /api/users/:id

Error responses follow standard HTTP status codes: 400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized access, 404 for not found, and 500 for server errors. All error responses include a JSON body with error message and code.
